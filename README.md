## Notes

Some of the challenges I faced while building the website included making small errors when using JavaScript array methods such as `reduce()` and `filter()`. For example, I mistakenly wrote `reduced` instead of `reduce`, which caused the total raised money not to display correctly. Similarly, small typos caused the filters not to function as expected. Debugging these issues taught me the importance of paying close attention to method names and carefully testing functionality.
